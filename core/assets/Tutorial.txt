              You might be thinking, “they misspelled polygon”. Well jokes on you we were making
                  a very bad pun (enter evil face here). Anyways let’s get to the tutorial!

                                                                                                              HOW TO PLAY

             Here in this low class game your goal is to be the fastest of them all, the best of the
             best, better than the rest, the cherry on top of a sundae, the only one that can make your family
             proud! Polygons will pop up onto the screen for your eyes to admire. For each polygon, you must enter
             the number of sides there are. Once you’ve enter the number you must press ENTER to go to the next
             polygon(which will randomize in sides). Easy right? Here’s the catch, there’s a timer counting from
             1 MINUTE and if you get your answers wrong the time will run out faster. Time flies when you’re 
             having fun. The more polygons you count through, the higher the score. Simple.
